All healthy contributions are appreciated and welcomed.
We use `Pytest` for unit and functional testing to help with keeping bugs from popping up.
See `pytest.ini` on how to run specific tests.

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/gearbot/Dashboard-api.git`
2. Install the project dependencies with `pip -r requirements.txt`
3. Assure your code behaves as expected, add comments where explanations may be needed
4. Run `pytest` to make sure the existing tests still succeed
5. Add any new tests or tweak existing ones to fit new behavior or features
6. Make sure all tests pass when you are finished
